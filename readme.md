# Headto

Tell your friends where you are heading.

A reimplementation of http://headto.in using some newer technologies.

## What is this?

Checking in after reaching a venue does not help anyone. How about checking in before hand so others can make it too?

How about spontaneous get-togethers? Meet people without having to plan.

_That's_ Headto.
